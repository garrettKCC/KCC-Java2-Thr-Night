UML Diagrams provide a visual representation of a process.  Diagrams are tools that
allow the designer to think through the process more clearly and identify any gaps
in understanding.  They allow designers to communicate with users to make sure there
is a common understanding, before doing a lot of work.
While UML can be very detailed and in-depth, it can be used at a high level to
provide a description of the main functionality of the system.
